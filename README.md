# Default Template

This default template serves as a boilerplate to create custom TikTok streams, any branch on this repository might represent a unique stream based on this template.

------------

This template needs:

- `Python and requirements.txt`
- `Redis` -> offered with setup.sh options
- `Minecraft Server` -> offered with setup.sh options

These are the availables base listeners the dispatcher offers:
- `live.comment`
- `live.join`
- `live.share`
- `live.like`
- `live.gift`
- `live.follow`

You can subscribe any functions to these to receive a profile generated by the function get_profile in `src/tools/sanitize.py`

Please refer to `_template.py` in the same folder to get the boiler plate code to create new stream components.

To send commands to minecraft either use
- `mc.post` -> if you directly send a command without the leading `/`
- `mc.lambda` -> if you send a dill.dumps serialized lambda

Either of these topics can be call/registered and publish/subscribed to.
